    <div className="mx-20 p-12">Refund Policy
    Please Note â€“ We maintain a strict non-refundable policy for all service packages. Once purchased, no refunds will be issued under any circumstances.
    
    Independence and Transparency
    We do not receive any form of compensation, payment, or benefits from our partners or subsidiaries for providing delivery or execution services related to products or securities for which we offer investment advice.
    
    No Endorsement of Brokers
    We do not endorse or recommend any specific stock or commodity brokers. If any broker is suggested by our representatives, we receive no compensation, payment, or benefits from that broker or any other intermediary. This ensures that our advice remains unbiased and independent.
    
    Compliance with the Investment Advisor Regulation 2013
    To comply with the Investment Advisor Regulation 2013, we have ensured that neither our firm nor any of its representatives engage in market transactions. We do not associate with any issuer of products or securities, which eliminates any actual or potential conflicts of interest.
    
    Uncompromised Objectivity
    We prioritize objectivity and independence when delivering investment advisory services. Our focus is always on providing unbiased guidance without external influence.
    
    Market Risk Disclaimer
    Investments in stock or commodity markets are subject to market risks. While we make every effort to analyze and forecast market trends, we cannot guarantee returns or accuracy. However, we provide performance sheets of various products for reference, though these should not be considered a guarantee of future results.
    
    Client Responsibility
    We advise clients to treat all recommendations as opinions. Clients should make investment decisions independently, using their judgment and risk tolerance.
    
    Suggestions on Existing Positions
    
    If clients seek advice on specific positions they have already taken, we will recommend the best course of action based on our analysis of the security or product. However, these suggestions are opinions, not formal advice. We recommend clients treat them as viewpoints and make their own decisions accordingly. We are not responsible for any losses clients may incur from acting on these opinions.
    
    Client Responsibility in Trading
    Additionally, we advise clients to trade only if the tips align with their current risk appetite and risk tolerance. All tips we provide are opinions, and clients must exercise discretion when executing trades. Ultimately, the decision to trade rests with the client, and they are responsible for their choices.
    
    Independence from Intermediaries
    Moreover, we maintain no associations with intermediaries and do not recommend the services of specific brokers. This ensures our advice remains independent and unbiased.
    
    Transparency and Accountability
    Furthermore, no claims have been filed against us since our inception. We communicate all suggested levels in writing. Therefore, any verbal communication from our directors or representatives should not be considered formal advice from our organization.</div>
